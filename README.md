# SwiftUI-Mixtape-Player
iOS app built in SwiftUi that provides a user inteface for creating playlists, listening, and skipping through songs that the user has stored in the Files app. 

### Why I made it: 
Ever sinice the death of iTunes iOS users have had no built-in way to nicely make playlist from, listen to, and view music they have downloaded on their devices. 
Since the introduction of the Files app we have been able to download files right from safari, maing it easy to download music that's unavailble on streaming services right to our iPhones from sites 
like [Datpiff.com](https://www.datpiff.com/). The only problem being the Files app doesn't have basic features for listening to this music, for example 
making playlists, skipping songs, or even just having the next song in the folder play after the first song finishes. 

### How it works:
Press the + icon on the first screen to create a new mixtape/playlist, select files, then you can rearange the song's orders, 
listen to them and skip forward/backwards through the playlist.

### implementation/What I learned: 
This app was built in Swift 5 using SwiftUi and CoreData. This is the first iOS app i've made
without following a full tutorial, so im sure there are many improvements and optimizations to be made, some that I mention below. I learned a lot while making this
including dealing with files in iOS and the app sandbox, persisting data using CoreData, and building user interfaces with SwiftUI.

### Future Features/Improvements: 
Theres a number of features and improvements to make that I hope to implement sometime like, a seeking bar to scrub through songs, control playback with control center and lock screen,
support for picking cover art from camera roll not only files app, and storing mixtapes and songs more efficiently.
